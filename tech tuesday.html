<div class="boxed-text">Raspberry pi’s are single board programming device made by the UK company Raspberry Pi foundation. They are meant to be incredibly easy devices for a range of experienced coders. Rasberry pi’s are a small and affordable computing keyboard that is often used for at home projects. People use these computers to better understand programming and generally at home projects. These computers vary from very affordable prices from $5-$100 with the goal to get all people around the world in coding. The foundations purpose is to make coding very simple and accessible for anyone that wants to learn. They obtain this by making low cost and high performance computers. 

Raspberry Pi’s aren’t only limited to their basic designs as countless creative people have been able to morph simple designs into creative concepts.

Here are two examples:

Mini Desktop DOS PC - created by Fantasticmrdavid this project resembles an old school desktop which was achieved by placing the pi inside of a DOS PC. It’s very useful as there are multiple bases to print for different Pi models and you can have microSD replaced by a floppy drive port. I believe this to be an innovative concept as it allows you to have your custom-made old-school laptop without having to go search for one on multiple different websites. The overall idea is also a great addition to the aesthetic of your home and can be seen by other creators who may be inspired to do the same and create a business out of it.

Ethernet over USB support: created by Alan, this project splits the USB port into the Ethernet and USB. This project involved designing a custom PCB from scratch. Similar to the WIZnet EVB the final result came out as a board with the same pin layout as Raspberry Pi Pico but with a few new components. It is an innovative concept as it can be used for those who don’t have their specialized board on hand. Shows that you don’t need to buy specific things when you can just create them yourselves from scratch. With this mindset, many more creators will emerge and start forming their variations of items not only expanding their mindset but the world’s because the more people do this the more influence it will have on us globally.

	In conclusion, Raspberry Pi devices have revolutionized the world of computing by offering affordable, accessible, and versatile tools for learning and innovation. Through projects like the Mini Desktop DOS PC and Ethernet over USB support, users can explore new ideas, learn new skills, and even turn their creations into businesses. The Raspberry Pi Foundation's commitment to making coding accessible to all has sparked a global movement of creativity and learning, inspiring people of all ages and backgrounds to delve into the world of technology and electronics. As more people continue to explore the possibilities of Raspberry Pi, we can expect to see even more innovative projects that push the boundaries of what is possible with these remarkable devices.

<div class="boxed-text">Computer hardware is the physical components of a computer. There are 2 components in hardware, internal and external hardware. External hardware are things like keyboards, monitors, printers, and scanners. In contrast, internal hardware would include RAM, motherboards, and hard drives.  
Hard drives are the components of the computer that involves storing long term digital information. This would include all pictures, videos, music, progams, applications, and all operating systems. Every piece of information saved on a hard drive has different sizes of files. Text documents are pieces of information that include more space to store rather than videos are the largest. Additionally, hard drives include other components that are important to preface before sticking to one, such as speed. 
	For example, the samsung T7 shield which is a piece of hardware in the form of a hard drive. A hardware, that’s perfect for anyone who needs their data to be safe no matter what location they’re in.  Built to handle mildly challenging g weather elements and is great when it comes to compatibility, playing well with everything from game consoles and PCs to Macs and Android devices. When it comes to the best external hard drive you’ll want to take storage, speed, portability, compatibility, toughness, back up and security and cost into account.
