  <h3 style="color:rgb(60, 126, 83);">Week 1:</h3>
  <div class="boxed-text" style="color: rgb(60, 126, 83);">
   During the first week we focused on setting up Github, VS code, code HS etc. We then had someone come in and present about Nokia and provide us with insightful information about it. After that we watched a movie for black history month and that is when she started to delve into our unit.
 </div>


<h3 style="color:rgb(60, 126, 83);">Week 2:</h3>
<div class="boxed-text" style="color: rgb(60, 126, 83);">
During the second week we still focused on setting everything up but eventually started our portfolio on Github.
</div>
  
  <h3 style="color:rgb(60, 126, 83);">Week 3:</h3>  
<div class="boxed-text" style="color: rgb(60, 126, 83);">
During the third week we started something called Tech Tuesday, which involved researching a certain topic with a partner. For this week the topic was Computer hardware. We also started CSE which focused on working with Rasbperry Pi. We only started by decorating our boxes though since it was just the beginning.
</div>
  
  <h3 style="color:rgb(60, 126, 83);">Week 4:</h3>  
<div class="boxed-text" style="color:rgb(60, 126, 83);">
We started Khan academy, a website that focuses on computers and their functions, like converting analog into binary numbers.
</div>

    <h3 style="color:rgb(60, 126, 83);">Week 5:</h3>  
<div class="boxed-text" style="color: rgb(60, 126, 83);">
We started CMU and learned how to use it by going through the course material and applying our knowledge by recreating an image on the canvas without any help except the knowledge we got from the lesson about the topic prior. We learned how to make shapes, add gradients, colours, lines, opacity, etc.
</div>

    <h3 style="color:rgb(60, 126, 83);">Week 6:</h3>  
<div class="boxed-text" style="color: rgb(60, 126, 83);">
  March break.
</div>

     <h3 style="color:rgb(60, 126, 83);">Week 7:</h3>  
<div class="boxed-text" style="color: rgb(60, 126, 83);">
  We continued with our regular schedule, working our websites, tech Tuesday, CMU, typing club, etc.
</div>
       <h3 style="color:rgb(60, 126, 83);">Week 8:</h3>  
<div class="boxed-text" style="color: rgb(60, 126, 83);">
 We focused more on our websites by adding links to pages containing our weekly journal, our class projects, and our tech Tuesday. We then began working on tech Tuesday and started AI lessons. This was Khan Academy but instead of us reading through the lesson and applying our knowledge through quizzes, we were given videos to watch and analyze which we then answered questions about. Wednesday continued with another CSE session where we worked on our Unicorn Hat and lit up its pixels with the various challenges we attempted to complete. We had an assignment on AI that focused on its ethical dilemma, which we swiftly completed by the end of the week.
</div>
  
    <h3 style="color:rgb(60, 126, 83);">Week 9:</h3>  
<div class="boxed-text" style="color: rgb(60, 126, 83);">
  We continued on CodeHS (AI) for unit 1.
</div>
      <h3 style="color:rgb(60, 126, 83);">Week 10:</h3>  
<div class="boxed-text" style="color: rgb(60, 126, 83);">
 We finally finished the first unit of CodeHS, moving on to the second. We did the first column but eventually, we stopped due to the lessons becoming increasingly to difficult for the students to complete. Like the tic tac toe, we had to somehow build even though the website never gave us a proper lesson on it or how to complete it.
</div>
        <h3 style="color:rgb(60, 126, 83);">Week 11:</h3>  
<div class="boxed-text" style="color: rgb(60, 126, 83);">
  We went back to CMU and began the second unit, focusing on functions, perimeters, calling codes, debugging codes, mouse press and release events, aligning, creating our commands, etc. In CSE we changed from our monitors to our computers.
</div>

          <h3 style="color:rgb(60, 126, 83);">Week 12:</h3>  
<div class="boxed-text" style="color: rgb(60, 126, 83);">
  We switched it up a bit this week. We focused on hardware and actually got the opportunity to take a apart a PC. We were put in groups and instructed to analyze the individual parts for our next two assignments we had to complete that related to this topic. For one of the projects, I was in a group with Ethan and Kayla where we created a poster about storage, focusing on facts about it, adding photos, talking about the 5 W's and the how. We handed this project in on friday. The other one was individual and was more lengthy then the first, it was about making your own computer where you go through hardware, software, operating systems, internet, and other components of the computer. I chose a desktop computer and my "occupation" was a University student who was looking for an easy way to gain a computer that will work well with my school work. We also had a spreadsheet where we had to add up the total cost of everything with all the parts included. On Wednesday we continued our CSE challenges like the oscillating dot and how to use the same logic ina column.
