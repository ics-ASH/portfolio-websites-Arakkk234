  <h3 style="color:rgb(60, 126, 83);">Week 1:</h3>
  <div class="boxed-text" style="color: rgb(60, 126, 83);">
   During the first week we focused on setting up Github, VS code, code HS etc. We then had someone come in and present about Nokia and provide us with insightful information about it. After that, we watched a movie for black history month and that is when she started to delve into our unit.
 </div>


<h3 style="color:rgb(60, 126, 83);">Week 2:</h3>
<div class="boxed-text" style="color: rgb(60, 126, 83);">
During the second week we still focused on setting everything up but eventually started our portfolio on GitHub.
</div>
  
  <h3 style="color:rgb(60, 126, 83);">Week 3:</h3>  
<div class="boxed-text" style="color: rgb(60, 126, 83);">
During the third week we started something called Tech Tuesday, which involved researching a certain topic with a partner. For this week the topic was Computer hardware. We also started CSE which focused on working with Raspberry Pi. We only started by decorating our boxes though since it was just the beginning.
</div>
  
  <h3 style="color:rgb(60, 126, 83);">Week 4:</h3>  
<div class="boxed-text" style="color:rgb(60, 126, 83);">
We started Khan academy, a website that focuses on computers and their functions, like converting analog into binary numbers.
</div>

    <h3 style="color:rgb(60, 126, 83);">Week 5:</h3>  
<div class="boxed-text" style="color: rgb(60, 126, 83);">
We started CMU and learned how to use it by going through the course material and applying our knowledge by recreating an image on the canvas without any help except the knowledge we got from the lesson about the topic prior. We learned how to make shapes, and add gradients, colours, lines, opacity, etc.
</div>

    <h3 style="color:rgb(60, 126, 83);">Week 6:</h3>  
<div class="boxed-text" style="color: rgb(60, 126, 83);">
  March break.
</div>

     <h3 style="color:rgb(60, 126, 83);">Week 7:</h3>  
<div class="boxed-text" style="color: rgb(60, 126, 83);">
  We continued with our regular schedule, working our websites, tech Tuesday, CMU, typing club, etc.
</div>
       <h3 style="color:rgb(60, 126, 83);">Week 8:</h3>  
<div class="boxed-text" style="color: rgb(60, 126, 83);">
 We focused more on our websites by adding links to pages containing our weekly journal, our class projects, and our tech Tuesday. We then began working on tech Tuesday and started AI lessons. This was Khan Academy but instead of us reading through the lesson and applying our knowledge through quizzes, we were given videos to watch and analyze which we then answered questions about. Wednesday continued with another CSE session where we worked on our Unicorn Hat and lit up its pixels with the various challenges we attempted to complete. We had an assignment on AI that focused on its ethical dilemma, which we swiftly completed by the end of the week.
</div>
  
    <h3 style="color:rgb(60, 126, 83);">Week 9:</h3>  
<div class="boxed-text" style="color: rgb(60, 126, 83);">
  We continued on CodeHS (AI) for unit 1.
</div>
      <h3 style="color:rgb(60, 126, 83);">Week 10:</h3>  
<div class="boxed-text" style="color: rgb(60, 126, 83);">
 We finally finished the first unit of CodeHS, moving on to the second. We did the first column but eventually, we stopped due to the lessons becoming increasingly too difficult for the students to complete. Like the tic tac toe, we had to somehow build it even though the website never gave us a proper lesson on it or how to complete it.
</div>
        <h3 style="color:rgb(60, 126, 83);">Week 11:</h3>  
<div class="boxed-text" style="color: rgb(60, 126, 83);">
  We went back to CMU and began the second unit, focusing on functions, perimeters, calling codes, debugging codes, mouse press and release events, aligning, creating our commands, etc. In CSE we changed from our monitors to our computers.
</div>

     <h3 style="color:rgb(60, 126, 83);">Week 12:</h3>  
<div class="boxed-text" style="color: rgb(60, 126, 83);">
  We continued CMU unit 2 and on Wednesday we continued with the challenges given to us for the Unicorn Hat. We focused on the intermediate challenges this time like creating an oscillating dot. We ended the week with a quiz on unit 2 of CMU.
 </div>
          <h3 style="color:rgb(60, 126, 83);">Week 13:</h3>  
<div class="boxed-text" style="color: rgb(60, 126, 83);">
  We switched it up a bit this week. We focused on hardware and got the opportunity to take apart a PC. We were put in groups and instructed to analyze the individual parts for the next two assignments we had to complete that related to this topic. For one of the projects, I was in a group with Ethan and Kayla where we created a poster about storage, focusing on facts about it, adding photos, and talking about the 5 W's and the hows. We handed this project in on Friday. The other one was individual and was more lengthy than the first, it was about making your computer where you go through hardware, software, operating systems, internet, and other components of the computer. I chose a desktop computer and my "occupation" was a University student who was looking for an easy way to gain a computer that would work well with my school work. We also had a spreadsheet where we had to add up the total cost of everything with all the parts included. On Wednesday we continued our CSE challenges like the oscillating dot and how to use the same logic in a column.

<div class="boxed-text" style="color: rgb(60, 126, 83);">
We started something new and unique this week. We worked with k8 a robot that we had to screw. My group consisted of Kian, Mervan, Gideon and me. On Wednesday we continued with CSE. On Thursday we continued with k8 but this time we accessed a website that connected to k8 and allowed her to move through the code. We used microbits to drive her around and raced with the other k8s by making her spin, move straight, move backwards, create images on the microbit, and so on.

<div class="boxed-text" style="color: rgb(60, 126, 83);">
  We spent time on k8 and CSE this week. We spent the majority of the week on k8 continuing what we did last week. On Wednesday we worked on the raspberry pi and it was the last day for Sammy.

   <h3 style="color:rgb(60, 126, 83);">Week 16:</h3>  
<div class="boxed-text" style="color: rgb(60, 126, 83);">
It was Victoria's day on Monday so we weren't at school, however, the rest of the week was productive. When we came back to school we continued to work on our websites, tweaking it here and there. On Wednesday we had CSE "test" which involved signing into our accounts on our own without any monitored help. On Thursday we designed k8 for the battle and on Friday we created posters for the event.

     <h3 style="color:rgb(60, 126, 83);">Week 17:</h3>  
<div class="boxed-text" style="color: rgb(60, 126, 83);">
On Monday we accessorized k8 and tweaked her code to make her fully ready for the battle. We also decorated her wall and set it up.
</div>

     <h3 style="color:rgb(60, 126, 83);">Week 18:</h3>  
<div class="boxed-text" style="color: rgb(60, 126, 83);">
  We worked on our websites mostly and had the battle with k8 on Monday. It was really fun and it was interesting to see the different codes our other classmates came up with for their robot controls.
