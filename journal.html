  <h3 style="color:brown;">Week 1:</h3>
  <div class="boxed-text" style="color: brown;">
   During the first week we focused on setting up Github, VS code, code HS etc. We then had someone come in and present about Nokia and provide us with insightful information about it. After that we watched a movie for black history month and that is when she started to delve into our unit.
