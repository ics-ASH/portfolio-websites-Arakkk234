  <h3 style="color:black;">Week 1:</h3>
  <div class="boxed-text" style="color: black;">
   During the first week we focused on setting up Github, VS code, code HS etc. We then had someone come in and present about Nokia and provide us with insightful information about it. After that we watched a movie for black history month and that is when she started to delve into our unit.

During the third week we started something called Tech Tuesday, which involved researching a certain topic with a partner. For this week the topic was Computer hardware. We also started CSE which focused on working with Rasbperry Pi. We only started by decorating our boxes though since it was just the beginning.
